        <h1>EXCLUSIVE CEYLON SAPPHIRES </h1>
        <p class="about-para">Deep intense blue combined with their high luster makes Sri Lankan sapphires very
          distinctive. The other unique characteristic of this precious stone is its hardness. It's 9 in Mohs scale &
          which makes sapphires the perfect choice for making jewelry with great durability.
          <br><br>
          Not just today, Ceylon Sapphires and Rubis were famous in the world for centuries and Sri Lanka has a
          remarkable gem mining and trading history of more than 2500 years. It was once called 'Rathnadeepa' with the
          meaning of "Gem Island" in Sinhala. Persian traders endearingly referred to the island as Serendib, as they
          believed these glorious treasures bring happiness and good fortune.
          <br><br>
          Some of the world's most famous sapphires have come from Sri Lanka including Blue Giant of the Orient (466
          carats) & Logan Blue Sapphire (423 carats). And also, Ceylon blue sapphires have been treasured by royal
          families around the world for centuries. Ceylon Sapphire elaborated Crown worn by Queen Catherine II of
          Russia, the Ceylon blue sapphire brooch given by Prince Albert to Queen Victoria and Princess Diana's renowned
          engagement ring are some of the examples of royalty of Ceylon sapphire.
          <br><br>
          While Ceylon Sapphires are famous for their lively vivid blue hues, Actually sapphires mine in Sri Lanka come
          in a variety of colors. And always their elegance and luster will take your breath away.
